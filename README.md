## **Enhanced Bone Regeneration in Rat Gingival Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Comparative Study of Inductive Media, Polycaprolactone Nano Scaffold, and Low-Level Laser Therapy** 
Temporal data were systematically analyzed across experimental phases to characterize molecular dynamics underlying enhanced bone regeneration in rat gingival mesenchymal stem cells. Protein expression patterns were modeled using the MEFISTO pipeline, an extension of MOFA2 designed for time-resolved multi-omics integration, highlighting coordinated molecular programs linked to regenerative processes.
Active transcription factors were inferred using the decoupleR framework, providing insight into key regulatory drivers of protein expression changes. To further elucidate the biological mechanisms, pathway crosstalk analysis was conducted to reveal potential regulatory interactions between active TFs and core enriched pathways. In addition, cellular heterogeneity was explored through single-sample deconvolution with CIBERSORT, using a signature matrix from Dental Cell Type Atlas in Mouse Jan (Krivanek et al., 2020), thereby mapping temporal protein signatures to specific cell-type contributions within the regenerative microenvironment.
